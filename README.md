# Intro-Component-with-Signup

This is a Front End Mentor Project and my first client side form validation project. 

Methodology

My process of solving this problem involved using semantical HTML to section the structure of the single page
I also use CSS to make the form page responsive with break points set to 600px. I opted for the CSS grid approach and as usual went mobile first. 

JavaScript Approach

My approach was to declare all the DOM elements critical to this design at the start of the js script- inputs and buttons. 

Then i develop functions to check classes on my style sheet and implement when conditions where met by the UI users. 

Finally added an conditional statement to show an alert if all input boxes meet the criteria.


Lessons learned

Learning about more DOM manipulation items and also improving on my CSS positioning. Initially had difficulty position items out of normal document flow, but this has been solved by research.
